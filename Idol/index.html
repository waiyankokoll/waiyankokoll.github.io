Walker moved to Fana, Bergen, Norway at the age of two with his two siblings.He knew little about music though he loved listening to it. As a result of that, he began watching YouTube tutorials where he learnt music and production.Alan Walker did not attend university; he completed his education up to high school. He had a strong interest in programming and video game design, which led him to self-learn music production and video editing.His entry into the music industry began by uploading his tracks to platforms like YouTube and SoundCloud, where he gradually gained recognition. Although he does not hold a formal degree in music production, his ability to blend technology and music has contributed to his success as a renowned DJ and producer.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>In 2012, Walker, who was listening to a song by Italian DJ David Whistle (also known as DJ Ness) reached out to him inquiring how he produced his music.He was inspired by Norwegian music producer K-391 and Dutch music producer Ahrix, and film composers Hans Zimmer and Steve Jablonsky.He started producing his music on his laptop using FL Studio. In July 2012, using feedback from his fans online, he began pursuing his music production and subsequently posted some of his videos on YouTube and SoundCloud.Starting as a bedroom producer, Walker was better known as DJ Walkzz before signing a record deal, releasing his debut single in 2014.After uploading some songs to YouTube, he released "Fade" on 17 August 2014.The song was re-released by the record label NoCopyrightSounds on November 19, 2014 to great attention, garnering 200 million views on YouTube in 2014. Walker said of its success, "it was mind-blowing."Walker stated that the creation of the track was inspired by K-391 and Ahrix, whose tracks were also picked up by the record label.The track has achieved milestones, especially with the view counts on streaming services.Walker continued his music career and released "Spectre" and "Force" on NCS in 2015. He signed with MER Musikk under Sony Music Sweden and released his next single, "Faded", a remastered vocal version of "Fade".
